# Haste Notes

Notes app that allows navigating notes without focusing the window with a focus on speed running Final Fanatasy games.

## Description

The whole idea of Haste Notes came from me trying to speed run Final Fantasy IX. Following a google doc was tedious at times.

So I wanted to create an app that would allow me to go through notes while not focusing the window but just playing the game.
It evolved from there and now there are 16 options when selecting a game with bosses from each game/and an option for no game so the app can be general for any game.

## Games

* Final Fantasy I
* Final Fantasy II
* Final Fantasy III
* Final Fantasy IV
* Final Fantasy V
* Final Fantasy VI
* Final Fantasy VII
* Final Fantasy VII
* Final Fantasy VIII
* Final Fantasy IX
* Final Fantasy X
* Final Fantasy XII
* Final Fantasy XIII
* Final Fantasy XV
* Final Fantasy XVI

You can select from these gamnes and when adding a new note you'll have the option to choose from bosses in that game.
